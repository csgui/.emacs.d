# csgui .emacs.d
This is my emacs configuration files. If you want to use them, the
best thing is probably to fork the project at Github
(<http://github.com/csgui/.emacs.d>) and then make your changes to that
branch.

## Installation
First of all make sure you have installed Emacs version 23 or higher.

### Source
Fetch the emacs source files:

    $ git clone git://github.com/csgui/.emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
